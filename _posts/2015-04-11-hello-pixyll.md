After a fair bit of researching, I've finally decided to make [Pixyll](http://pixyll.com) my GitHub blogging framework, for a while at least. The primary reason for me to choose it over others seems to come down to its clean UI and the content-aware design. [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/) also has a great look but I like the way Pixyll displays its navigation bar without the aid of a side menu.

This is my first time using GitHub Pages with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). It should be an exciting experience.
